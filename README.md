# Global Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis with Python

This project analyzes global trends in **life expectancy** and **GDP** over time using real-world data.  
It uses **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to clean, process, and visualize the data.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes life expectancy and GDP data for several countries over multiple years.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (renamed columns, grouped data).
- Created pivot tables to analyze life expectancy over time by country.
- Visualized trends using line charts for better understanding.
- Analyzed how GDP trends compare with life expectancy.
